Naruto Avatars Collection
-------------------------

Please use these avatars for IM, forums or any other avatar needs.
Please do not pass them off as your own work as they not only my work, but based on Naruto's creator Masashi Kishimoto's work and MSN's people icons. So no selling ;)

I have included 128x128px hires versions for other sizes and DA standard 50x50px PNGs as well.
